# Liars-Dice
Ongoing Liar's Dice project. Might try to find an animator so this can be used as an overlay in Sea of Thieves.

# How to play Liars Dice:

Each player is given a cup and 5 dice at the start of the game. Each round progresses like so:

1. Everyone uses the cup provided to shake their dice. Once thoroughly shook, place the cup and the dice down on the table so that the dice are hidden
2. Lift the cup slightly so only you can see the dice you’ve rolled.
  - Throughout the game, players can lift their cup if they forget what numbers they rolled, or if they want to play mind games.
3. The player who goes first can be chosen in whatever way the players see fit.
4. The leading player throws out a guess in the format of “[Number 1-infinity] [Number 1-6]”
  a. Ex. “Five Fours” “Three Twos” “Nine Sevens”
5. The player to the left of them now gets to raise the guess or challenge the previous player.
  a. If the player chooses to raise, they must guess something higher than the person before them. 
    - Ex. If player A said “Three Fours” 
    - then player B must say “Four Fours” or “[Number 1-infinity][Number 5-6]]” 
    - They cannot say “Two Fours” or “Five Threes”
  b. If the player chooses to challenge, then everyone reveals what they rolled and they count how many dice of the guessed number there are.
    - Ex. if player A said “Seven Sixes” then everyone says how many sixes they rolled. Ones count as wild cards so they apply to every count.
    - If the number of dice is greater than or equal to the challenged guess, the person who challenged loses a dice and places it in the center of the table or somewhere that people can see easily.
    - If there are less dice than the challenged guess, the person who made the initial guess loses their dice and places it in the center of the table or somewhere that can be seen easily.
6. The game proceeds in a clockwise fashion around the table until there is no one remaining. If you run out of dice you are out of the game.
